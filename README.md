Dear Mr. Carr,
Here is our group's attempt at simulating a professional development environment.  We have completed this project using an IDE 
with collaborative features (which we are so glad we spent the first week of development just setting up) as well as GitHub.  To play
the game, go ahead and run src/sample/Main.  Other than that, have a nice summer and we hope you stay safe!
