Welcome to AutoCarr, a game made entirely in JavaFX (why we decided to shoot ourselves in the foot by not using a game engine beats me).  
It is a Teamfight Tactics game made for two players.  Purchase units at the beginning of each round and watch them automatically seek out and
destroy opposing units!
